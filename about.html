	<h2><b>About My Self</b></h2>
	<h5>
		<p>Hello my name is <a href="contact.html">David Benitez,</a> I am currently studying for Tech Start in <a href="https://obtjobs.org/home/">OBT</a>. My main intrest is studying for automotive engineering. The main reason I joined Tech Start mainly to get a better job, and learn more about computers. After earning enough money I am planning on going back to school and persue my goals in life. One school that has intrested me is <a href="https://www.uti.edu/request-info">UTI</a>, this school teaches Engineering for different type of vehicles both, land and sea. My main goal is to hopefully one day work in the Formula1, <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1/understanding-f1-racing.html">F1</a>is "an international form of auto racing, whose races are called Grand Prix". I was intrested since a kid when I use to play racing games on my PlaStation&#169;. Another Subject that intrest me is astronomy. As a kid I always wondered if we could all go to the moon or beyond. NASA is one of my dream jobs and one way I could reach this goal is by studying aeronautics at <a href="https://www.vaughn.edu/engineering-technology-degrees/">Vaughn College</a>. The Main reason engineering has always intrested me is because I like Hands on work and also like seeing progress with my work.
